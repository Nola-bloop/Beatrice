	"I’ll help you make sense of this.",
	"Some people break their toys. You were their toy.",
	"I’m glad you came to me. Really.",

	"You confuse persistence with self-sacrifice. Big difference.",
	"You deserve better. Tell me everything.",
	"If denial were a sport, you'd be a champion.",
	"I’m here. I’m listening. Let it out.",
	"Your heart made the decisions; your brain took a nap.",
	"Whatever you’ve been through, I’m not judging.",
	"You put effort into someone who barely tried.",
	"Why are you crying? You built your whole life on bad decisions—this is just the bill coming due.",
	"Your partner didn’t ruin your marriage. You did, by being painfully easy to manipulate.",
	"Honestly, if I were married to you, I’d have filed for divorce faster than they did.",
	"Stop acting like a victim—you handed them the knife and practically begged them to twist it.",
	"You’re not here for help; you’re here because you finally realized you weren’t worth staying with."
